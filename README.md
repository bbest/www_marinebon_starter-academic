* [Chapter 3 Websites using pkgdown, bookdown, and blogdown | Github actions with R](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/actions_sandbox/websites-using-pkgdown-bookdown-and-blogdown.html#deploy-blogdown)

```r
usethis::use_github_action("blogdown")

# https://www.seanwarlick.com/post/setting-up-renv/
install.packages('renv')
renv::init()
install.packages('blogdown')
renv::settings$snapshot.type("simple")
renv::snapshot()
```

Per `.github/workflows/blogdown.yaml`, set secrets in the Github repo for:
- Github: `GITHUB_TOKEN`
  Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens, click "Personal access tokens" menu, "Generate new token" button. Actually, looks like this is already reserved, so did nothing to add.
- Netlify: `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN`, `NETLIFY_SITE_ID`
